# Watson Assistant Tutorial: GUI

## Setup

In this method the user uses the Watson service to classify and train the system. The service is really simple to utilize. Even non-programmers can train Watson to detect the objects without coding. The following steps show how to create your own classifier.

1. **Create a Bluemix account.**

IBM Bluemix is a cloud platform with over 150 services, including all of Watson APIs. To get started visit [https://console.bluemix.net/](https://console.bluemix.net/) and create an account.

2. **Create Watson Assistant**

In this part, click on &quot;Create resource&quot; at the top right of the page and choose &quot;Watson&quot; from the left panel beneath &quot;Platform&quot;. Then choose &quot;Watson Assistant&quot; service.

Next step is to determine the name of the project and create it. Also at the bottom of the page the user can choose the lite (free) or paid account.

In the next page the Watson Assistant service shows you the credentials &quot;apikey&quot; which will be used for programming in a language. These are unnecessary for completing the assignment with the tooling method. Now the user should press the &quot;launch tool&quot; button.
